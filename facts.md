# Interesting Facts

*   The decision tree covered 39,600,351,708 traversals!
*   There are 697,887 *achievable* outcomes of 1,417,176 *potential* outcomes.
    *   That means there are 719,289 outcomes that are impossible to achieve.
*   111 outcomes are uniquely achievable (i.e., they have only one traversal).
    *   These outcomes have the following in common:
        *   Miranda survives and is loyal.
        *   Garrus is *not* loyal.
        *   Jacob is *not* loyal.
    *   Note that Garrus, Jacob, and Miranda are all *ideal leaders*. That is,
        if they are loyal when selected as a leader during the suicide mission,
        a death will be avoided.
*   The greatest number of traversals for any outcome is 62,147,162.
    *   Unsurprisingly, that outcome spares only loyal Jacob, loyal Miranda,
        and the crew.
*   The ten most common outcomes cover 373,227,856 traversals.
*   The one hundred most common outcomes cover 1,767,031,966 traversals.
*   The one thousand most common outcomes cover 6,807,718,024 traversals.
*   Morinth is more likely to survive than a loyal Samara.
    *   Loyal Samara's survival rate is 87.1% of Morinth's.
*   There are 324,677,659 ways to prevent Shepard from surviving the suicide
    mission (less than two allies survive).
    *   In other words, Shepard survives 99.18% of all traversals.

_NOTE: Morinth is not included in the table above due to her dependence on
Samara's loyalty mission._

_NOTE: Survival implies recruitment. That is, if an ally is not recruited, they
are **not** regarded as survived._
